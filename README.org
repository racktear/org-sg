* Org-Mode static site/blog generator

This module is intended to extend org-mode HTML publishing capabilities
providing a list of post excerpts, pagination and page templates.

It's on the inception/experimentation stage.
Use/try it out for fun, but expect things to break often.

Usage information will be added later.
